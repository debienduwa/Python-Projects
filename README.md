WEEK 1
Explain the problem: "Predict the price of houses based on various features such as
size, location, number of rooms, etc."
This project aims to predict the price of houses based on various features such as size, location,
number of rooms among other characteristics. By evaluating these characteristics, it will help
develop a prediction model that estimates a house's sale price. This type of study can help real
estate brokers, buyers, and sellers make more informed decisions.
Discuss the importance of regression analysis in predictive modeling.
Regression analysis is helpful in financial forecasting to model relationships between financial
variables, such as stock prices and economic indicators. It can help identify trends, estimate
future values, and manage financial risk by analyzing historical data and making informed
predictions based on relevant factors
Data Collection: Provide students with a dataset from Kaggle or an open dataset (e.g.,
House Prices dataset).
Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas.

Data Exploration and Cleaning Tasks: exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques: Descriptive
statistics (mean, median, etc.) Identifying missing values, outliers, and data types. Clean the
data: Fill or drop missing values. Handle outliers. Normalize or scale numerical data if
necessary.
Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization.
Week 2: Data Exploration and Cleaning
Following the collection of the dataset, exploration and cleaning of the data are necessary to have it ready for modeling. First, the exploratory data analysis is done using descriptive statistics, such as means, medians, and other measures of central tendency, to summarize the dataset. It is also important in EDA to identify missing values, outliers, and data types to get an idea about the quality of the dataset. Cleaning the data may include filling in missing values by using mean or median imputation or dropping rows/columns if the missing data is extensive. Outliers can be handled using capping, which limits extreme values, or applying transformations to normalize their impact. Normalizing or scaling of numerical data is often necessary to make sure that all features contribute equally during model training. The key libraries that are used throughout include matplotlib and seaborn for visualization to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, and pandas for data cleaning. Week 3: Feature Engineering and Selection Once the data has been cleaned, the next step is feature engineering and selection to enhance and optimize the features. Feature engineering means the creation of new, meaningful variables; for example, the calculation of price per square foot can add value to the dataset. Interaction features, capturing relationships between already existing variables, can also be generated in order to strengthen the model. Feature selection is equally important to focus the model on the most relevant predictors. Correlation analysis helps in identifying the relations between different variables, while multicollinearity detection based on the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) helps to make sure that selected features are not redundant. At this stage, the dataset is divided into a training and testing subset in preparation for model evaluation. The essential libraries used in manipulation, such as pandas, and in data splitting like scikit-learn, are critical in this process.

Week 4: Model Building
Model building begins by understanding the principles of linear regression, a widely used technique for predicting continuous outcomes. Linear regression works by modeling the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable as a linear equation. Using the training dataset, a simple linear regression model is built to predict house prices. Scikit-learn, a robust machine learning library, is used to implement and train the regression model. Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measures average prediction error; Mean Squared Error (MSE), which penalizes larger errors more heavily; and R-squared, which explains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. These evaluations ensure that the model is performing adequately and can guide future improvements.

Week 5: Model Evaluation and Reporting
The final phase focuses on evaluating the model on unseen test data to ensure that it generalizes well and can make accurate predictions in real-world scenarios. This involves analyzing the model's performance and discussing potential improvements, such as adding new features or experimenting with advanced algorithms like Decision Trees. A comprehensive final report is then prepared, summarizing the entire project. This report should include the problem definition, the data exploration and cleaning process, the model-building methodology, the results, and conclusions with recommendations for next steps. To make the model accessible, it can be deployed as a web application using tools like Flask or Streamlit, allowing users to interact with it via a user-friendly interface. This deployment ensures that the project has practical, real-world utility.
